# Automated-Historical-Record-Transciption (AHRT)
From the late 18th century to the early 20th century, French and Belgian historical records were meticulously documented by scribes. These records, spanning from the 1790s to the 1920s, contain invaluable information about individuals and events, forming a vital resource for genealogists, historians, and researchers interested in societal changes over time. Among these records are 10-year tablesâ€”summarized indices compiled at decade intervals, containing abstracts of names and key details from various documents, such as birth, marriage, and death records.

Most of these indices remain untranscribed, locked in handwritten form, making it challenging for researchers to manually sift through countless pages. Transcribing and making these indices searchable would greatly enhance access, allowing researchers to efficiently trace lineages, study demographics, and analyze social changes.

The MLAHRTED project aims to address this by leveraging machine learning to automate transcription on edge devices. This approach uses decentralized technology, enabling document processing without constant server connectivity. Advanced models recognize diverse handwriting styles, converting them into machine-readable text. By deploying on edge devices, the project facilitates transcription even with limited internet, promoting broader access to historical research.

MLAHRTED aims to preserve these documents and democratize access, making it easier for researchers and enthusiasts to explore the rich history within. By transforming handwritten abstracts into searchable data, the project saves time and effort, opening new possibilities for historical discovery.
